# Evaluating Output

For this example we take the case of *Viral Sinusitis* and several
treatments as events. We set our `minEraDuration = 7`,
`minCombinationDuration = 7` and `combinationWindow = 7`. We treat
multiple events of *Viral Sinusitis* as separate cases by setting
`concatTargets = FALSE`. When set to `TRUE` it would append multiple
cases, which might be useful for time invariant target cohorts like
chronic conditions.

)
```

    ## Wrote csv-files to: /tmp/RtmpailPfZ

## Saving results

Now that we ran our TreatmentPatterns analysis and have exported our
results, we can evaluate the output. The
[`export()`](https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/TreatmentPatterns/reference/export.md)
function in TreatmentPatterns returns an R6 class of
`TreatmentPatternsResults`. All results are query-able from this object.
Additionally the files are written to the specified `outputPath`. If no
`outputPath` is set, only the result object is returned, and no files
are written.

If you would like to save the results to csv-, or zip-file after the
fact you can still do this. Or upload it to a database:

``` r
# Save to csv-, zip-file
results$saveAsCsv(path = tempdir())
```

    ## Wrote csv-files to: /tmp/RtmpailPfZ

``` r
results$saveAsZip(path = tempdir(), name = "tp-results.zip")
```

    ## Wrote zip-file to: /tmp/RtmpailPfZ

``` r
# Upload to database
connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
  dbms = "sqlite",
  server = file.path(tempdir(), "db.sqlite")
)

results$uploadResultsToDb(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  schema = "main",
  prefix = "tp_",
  overwrite = TRUE,
  purgeSiteDataBeforeUploading = FALSE
)
```

### treatmentPathways

The treatmentPathways file contains all the pathways found, with a
frequency, pairwise stratified by age group, sex and index year.

``` r
head(results$treatment_pathways)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 8
    ##   pathway               freq age   sex   index_year analysis_id target_cohort_id
    ##   <chr>                <int> <chr> <chr> <chr>            <dbl>            <dbl>
    ## 1 acetaminophen-amoxi…   103 all   all   all                  1                8
    ## 2 acetaminophen-penic…    55 all   all   all                  1                8
    ## 3 aspirin-acetaminoph…    52 all   all   all                  1                8
    ## 4 acetaminophen-penic…    49 all   all   all                  1                8
    ## 5 acetaminophen-amoxi…    42 all   all   all                  1                8

    ## # ℹ 1 more variable: target_cohort_name <chr>

We can see the pathways contain the treatment names we provided in our
event cohorts. Besides that we also see the paths are annoted with a `+`
or `-`. The `+` indicates two treatments are a combination therapy,
i.e. `amoxicillin+clavulanate` is a combination of *amoxicillin* and
*clavulanate*. The `-` indicates a switch between treatments,
i.e. `acetaminophen-penicillinv` is a switch from *acetaminophen* to
*penicillin v*. Note that these combinations and switches can occur in
the same pathway, i.e. `acetaminophen-amoxicillin+clavulanate`. The
first treatment is *acetaminophen* that *switches* to a combination of
*amoxicillin* and *clavulanate*.

### countsAge, countsSex, and countsYear

The countsAge, countsSex, and countsYear contain counts per age, sex,
and index year.

``` r

### summaryStatsTherapyDuration

The summaryEventDuration contains summary statistics from different
events, across all found “lines”. A “line” is equal to the level in the
Sunburst or Sankey diagrams. The summary statistics allow for plotting
of boxplots with the
[`plotEventDuration()`](https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/TreatmentPatterns/reference/plotEventDuration.md)
function.

``` r
results$plotEventDuration()
```

![](a030_Evaluating_Output_files/figure-html/summaryStatsTherapyDuration-1.png)

Not that besides our events there are two extra rows: *mono-event*, and
*combination-event*. These are both types of events on average.

We see that most events last between 0 and 100 days. We can see that for
*combination-events* and *amoxicillin+clavulanate* there is a tendency
for events to last longer than that. *amoxicillin+clavulanate* most
likely skews the duration in the *combination-events* group.

We can alter the x-axis to get a clearer view of the durations of the
events:

``` r
results$plotEventDuration() +
  ggplot2::xlim(0, 100)
```

![](a030_Evaluating_Output_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png) Now
we can more clearly investigate particular treatments. We can see that
*penicilin v* tends to last quite short across all treatment lines,
while *aspirin* and *acetaminophen* seem to skew to a longer duration.

Additionally we can also set a `minCellCount` for the individual events.

``` r
results$plotEventDuration(minCellCount = 10) +
  ggplot2::xlim(0, 100)
```

![](a030_Evaluating_Output_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

### metadata

The metadata file is a file that contains information about the
circumstances the analysis was performed in, and information about R,
and the CDM.

``` r
results$metadata
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   execution_start package_version r_version   platform execution_end analysis_id
    ##             <dbl> <chr>           <chr>       <chr>            <dbl>       <dbl>
    ## 1     1770798710. 3.1.2           R version … x86_64-…   1770798734.           1

### Sunburst Plot & Sankey Diagram

From the filtered treatmentPathways file we are able to create a
sunburst plot.

The inner most layer is the first event that occurs, going outwards.
This aligns with the event duration plot we looked at earlier.

``` r
results$plotSunburst()
```

Legend

We can also create a Sankey Diagram, which in theory displays the same
data. Additionally you see the *Stopped* node in the Sankey diagram.
This indicates the end of the pathway. It is mostly a practical addition
so that single layer Sankey diagrams can still be plotted.

``` r
results$plotSankey()
```
